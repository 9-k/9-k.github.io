This was made with xetex, so it probably will not compile right on your machine.
Actually, I know it won't - I hardcoded the font references in the modified .sty file.
That I stole from https://github.com/hamaluik/Beamer-Theme-Execushares.
Also, the animation won't work unless you're viewing the PDF on Acrobat or Okular. 
Even then, that support will probably be discontinued soon, so. Y'know. Probably will break.
